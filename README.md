# simulations
Framework for creating simulation demos and presenting them in a convenient way.

## Features
- easily dockable ImGui windows,
- separation of calculation, configuration and presentation layers,
- frame-based or fixed simulation timestep,
- listener-based communication interface between main simulation object and plot windows,
- easy implementation of new ODE solving algorithms (Euler and 4th order Runge-Kutta already implemented)

## Demos
- different techniques of angle interpolation in animation,
- hodograph of movement of an object attached to a flywheel,
- soft body (BÃ©zier cube) simulation with collisions,
- PUMA robot: inverse kinematics and interpolation techniques,
- simple 2D kinematic chain pathfinding with presence of obstacles,
- spinning top simulation,
- single mass on spring simulation
